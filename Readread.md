It looks like you're trying to create a new pluggable database (PDB) in Oracle with a specific character set, but you're encountering a syntax error. Let me help you fix that SQL statement.

The error "ORA-00922: missing or invalid option" is occurring because there's a syntax issue with your CREATE PLUGGABLE DATABASE statement. Let me rewrite it with proper formatting and fix the issues:

```sql
CREATE PLUGGABLE DATABASE pdb_us7ascii
ADMIN USER pdbadmin IDENTIFIED BY PdbAdmin123
ROLES = (DBA)
DEFAULT TABLESPACE users
DATAFILE 'C:\Oracle21c\oradata\pdb_us7ascii\pdb_us7ascii_users01.dbf' SIZE 500M AUTOEXTEND ON
FILE_NAME_CONVERT = ('C:\Oracle21c\oradata\ORCL\ORCLPDB', 'C:\Oracle21c\oradata\pdb_us7ascii')
PATH_PREFIX = 'C:\Oracle21c\oradata\pdb_us7ascii\'
CHARACTER SET US7ASCII
NATIONAL CHARACTER SET AL16UTF16;
```

The main issues I noticed:
1. You had an asterisk (*) instead of a closing quote (') in the DATAFILE path
2. You had an asterisk (*) in your FILE_NAME_CONVERT destination path
3. The line numbers (2-9) included in your statement might have been interpreted as part of the SQL command

This corrected statement should work properly. Would you like me to explain any specific part of this SQL command in more detail?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
