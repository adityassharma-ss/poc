Oracle XE 21c Database Access Guide for Developers
Prepared for: DevOps, Development & QA Teams
Environment: Azure
Database Host: Oracle Linux VM
Client Access: Windows VDI using SQL Developer
Database: Oracle XE 21c (Container DB with XEPDB1 as Pluggable Database)

1. Overview
This document describes the steps for developers to connect to, access, and interact with an Oracle XE 21c database instance running on an Oracle Linux VM hosted in Azure. Developers will use SQL Developer installed on their Windows VDIs to connect to the database.

2. Prerequisites
On the Oracle VM (Linux)
Oracle XE 21c Installed: Ensure Oracle XE 21c is installed and configured.

Listener Running: The listener should be running on port 1521.

Firewall Configuration: The firewall must allow inbound connections to port 1521.

Oracle Database: The Oracle database should be up and running with the Pluggable Database (PDB) named XEPDB1.

System Account Credentials: Ensure you know the password for the system account.

Network Access: There should be network connectivity between the Windows VDIs and the Oracle Linux VM.

On Windows VDI
Network Access: Ensure that the VDI has network access to the Oracle Linux VMâ€™s private IP.

SQL Developer: Ensure SQL Developer is installed on the VDI.

3. Oracle VM Configuration
Open Firewall on Oracle Linux VM
Run the following commands to open port 1521 in the firewall for database access:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=1521/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
Verify the Oracle listener:

bash
Copy
Edit
lsnrctl status
4. Oracle Database Setup
To ensure the database is properly configured, connect to the database and create a test table.

Connect to Oracle XE as SYSTEM User
bash
Copy
Edit
sqlplus system@localhost/XEPDB1
Create a Test Table
sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE TABLE test_users (
  id NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  username VARCHAR2(50),
  created_at DATE DEFAULT SYSDATE
);

INSERT INTO test_users (username) VALUES ('vdi_user1');
INSERT INTO test_users (username) VALUES ('vdi_user2');

COMMIT;

SELECT * FROM test_users;
5. Connecting from Windows VDI to Oracle VM
Open SQL Developer: Launch SQL Developer on the Windows VDI.

Create a New Connection: Click on New Connection and fill in the following details:


Field	Value
Connection Name	OracleXE
Username	system (or any other user created)
Password	(Password provided separately)
Hostname	<Oracle VM Private IP>
Port	1521
Service Name	XEPDB1
Connection Type	Basic
Test Connection: Click on Test to check if the connection is successful.

Connect: Once the connection test passes, click Connect to access the database.

6. Best Practices and Security
Credentials: Do not share your Oracle credentials with unauthorized users.

Use Read-Write Users for Applications: Avoid using the system or sys accounts for application-level access. Create separate users for applications.

Environment Variables: Set the following environment variables in .bash_profile for persistence:

bash
Copy
Edit
export ORACLE_HOME=/opt/oracle/product/21c/dbhomeXE
export PATH=$ORACLE_HOME/bin:$PATH
export ORACLE_SID=XE
Database Backups: Regularly back up the Oracle database to ensure data integrity.

7. Optional: Create Developer User
For security reasons, avoid using the system account. You can create a new developer user as follows:

Create Developer User
sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE USER dev_user IDENTIFIED BY DevUserPass123!;
GRANT CONNECT, RESOURCE TO dev_user;
ALTER SESSION SET CONTAINER = XEPDB1;
8. Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues during connection or usage, refer to the following troubleshooting tips:

Common Errors and Resolutions

Error	Resolution
ORA-01017	Invalid username/password. Reset via SYSDBA if necessary.
ORA-12154	Check the service name XEPDB1 and ensure it is correct.
Can't reach Oracle VM from VDI	Ensure network rules are correctly configured and port 1521 is open.
SQL Developer Timeout	Confirm that the Oracle listener is running and accessible.
